Title Page,Le Charivari,"Honoré Daumier made sketches and lithographs for Charles Philipon's political satirical journals, La Silhouette, La Caricature, and then Le Charivari.

Title Page,,"Honoré Daumier's criticism of the Franco-Prussian War is evident throughout his Album du Siège lithographs. His works offer a scathing indictment of the conflict, and the suffering it inflicted upon ordinary people. The series is a testament to Daumier's skill as a social commentator and artist, and remains a significant work of political satire to this day.","https://iiif.library.vanderbilt.edu/iiif/2/gallery%2F1999%2F1999.172gg.tif/0,0,2620,3422/800,/0/default.jpg"
Title Page,,"Daumier also focused on the suffering of civilians during the war, particularly the hunger and deprivation caused by the siege of Paris. The desperateness and hunger of Parisians was represented by a Crowned Paris eating rats.

Title Page,Crowned Paris,"Starvation and food scarcity even drove civilians to eat cats and dogs to survive: ""Cut off from supplies from the countryside, the Parisians held out by eating dogs, cats, and even most of the animals in the Paris zoo. The trees on the Champs-Elysées and in parks were cut down and burned for fuel.” Therefore, Daumier targeted the corrupt and ineffectual government officials who were responsible for the war and its disastrous consequences.

"Le Bombardement. Qu’estce que c’est que ça, papa? C’est le dernier bouquet des feux du 15 août.",,"Daumier is known for critically depicting the sociopolitical climate in France during the nineteenth century. Daumier empathized with Les Bons Bourgeois (the urban middle class). Daumier printed this lithograph in his Album du Siège, which depicts scenes of everyday life amidst the chaos of the Franco-Prussian war, the siege of Paris, and political satire aimed at the government and its leaders. France declared war on Prussia in July 1870, but was quickly defeated due to Prussia's superior military and tactics. The war had a devastating impact on French civilians, particularly those living in Paris, which was besieged for several months. Parisians' lives altered dramatically during the four month siege. During 23 nights of bombardement in January 1871, some 12,000 shells fell on Paris neighborhoods, killing about 400 people.

Le Bombardement,,"However, the dialogue between the father and son reveals that these are not fireworks at all, but bombs falling on the city. The title's reference to a fireworks display on August 15th adds a layer of irony to the scene, remeniscent of Louis Napoleon’s decree of moving the national holiday from the original Bastille Day on July 14 to August 15, known as La Saint-Napoléon.

Laissez appuyer moa…,Question d'Orient,"This phrase translates to the “Eastern Question,” which is a reference to the declining stability of the Ottoman Empire.

"Moi, je suis ravitaille!",,"This smug official, surrounded by crates of food and drink, represents those in the French nobility class during the 19th century. The official's dismissive statement highlights the callousness and lack of empathy shown by those in positions of privilege and power, especially during times of war. Daumier's use of caricature and satire in this lithograph is particularly effective, as he highlights the absurdity of the official's attitude and draws attention to the suffering and starvation of the less fortunate while Paris was under siege.","https://iiif.library.vanderbilt.edu/iiif/2/gallery%2F1999%2F1999.172b.tif/273,928,1932,1948/800,/0/default.jpg"
