Title Page,,"Honoré Daumier (1808-1879) was a French painter, sculptor, and printmaker. Empathizing with Les Bons Bourgeois (the urban middle class), Daumier critically depicted the tumultuous sociopolitical climate in France during the nineteenth century through his lithographs. He also illustrated scenes of everyday life amidst the chaos of the Franco-Prussian War, the siege of Paris, and political satire aimed at the government and its leaders.","https://iiif.library.vanderbilt.edu/iiif/2/gallery%2F1999%2F1999.172gg.tif/0,0,2620,3422/800,/0/default.jpg"
Title Page,Le Charivari,"Honoré Daumier produced lithographs for Charles Philipon's political satirical journals, La Silhouette, La Caricature, and then Le Charivari. The latter was where this collection, the Album du Siège, was published in the series “Actualités” (News of the Day) between the years 1870-1871. Daumier contributed an average of 8 lithographs per month. ","https://iiif.library.vanderbilt.edu/iiif/2/gallery%2F1999%2F1999.172gg.tif/698,1713,1153,373/800,/0/default.jpg"
,Title Page,"In his Album du Siège, Daumier offers a scathing indictment of the Franco-Prussian War — caused by geopolitical tensions between the two countries and the French government's belief that a war could revitalize Emperor Napoléon III's waning popularity — and the suffering it inflicted upon ordinary people. The series is a testament to Daumier's skill as a social commentator and artist, and remains a significant work of political satire.","https://iiif.library.vanderbilt.edu/iiif/2/gallery%2F1999%2F1999.172gg.tif/0,0,2620,3422/800,/0/default.jpg"
Title Page,,"Daumier also focused on the suffering of civilians, particularly the famine and deprivation caused by the siege of Paris, which was a Prussian maneuver to capture the city during the climax of the war. The desperation and hunger of the Parisians is represented by a Crowned Paris eating rats.","https://iiif.library.vanderbilt.edu/iiif/2/gallery%2F1999%2F1999.172gg.tif/596,20,1369,969/800,/0/default.jpg"
Title Page,Crowned Paris,"Starvation and food scarcity drove civilians to not only eat rats but also cats, dogs, and even animals from the Paris Zoo. The dreadful living conditions drove Daumier to target the corrupt and ineffectual government officials who were responsible for the escalation of the siege and its disastrous consequences.

"Le Bombardement. Qu’estce que c’est que ça, papa? C’est le dernier bouquet des feux du 15 août.",,"In this lithograph, Daumier depicts a scene of everyday life amidst the chaos of the Paris siege during the Franco-Prussian war.

Le Bombardement,,"The war had a devastating impact on Parisians as the city was besieged for several months. Parisians' lives altered dramatically during the four-month siege. The provisional “Government of National Defense” took over after the fall of Napoleon III's Empire. During this turbulent time, the food supply depleted and the economy suffered.

Le Bombardement ,,"The lithograph portrays ""The Bombardment,"" referencing the bombing of Paris by Prussian troops during the siege. For example, during 23 nights of bombardment in January 1871, some 12,000 shells fell on Paris neighborhoods, killing about 400 people.

Le Bombardement,,"The ""fireworks"" are not fireworks at all but bombs falling on the city. The dialogues's reference to a firework display on August 15 adds a layer of irony to the scene. The fireworks are reminiscent of Napoléon III's decree of moving the national holiday from the original Bastille Day on July 14 to August 15, known as La Saint-Napoléon, during his reign. The “last of the fireworks” expresses the fall of the empire and its replacement with the French Republic, under which the Paris siege occurred.
