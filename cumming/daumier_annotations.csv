"Honorée Daumier was one of the various artists for Charles Philipon's political satirical journals, La Silhouette, then La Caricature, and Le Charivari. Daumier is known for his lithographs critically depicting the sociopolitical climate in France during the nineteenth century. Daumier empathized with Les Bons Bourgeois (the urban middle class). This lithograph like many of Daumier's in his Album du Siège, created during the siege of Paris in 1870-71, depict scenes of everyday life amidst the chaos of the Franco-Prussian war as well as political satire aimed at the government and its leaders. France declared war on Prussia in July 1870, but was quickly defeated due to Prussia's superior military and tactics. The war had a devastating impact on French civilians, particularly those living in Paris, which was besieged for several months. Daumier's ability to capture the nuances of human expression and emotion is on full display in these lithographs. The series is a testament to Daumier's skill as a social commentator and artist, and remains a significant work of political satire to this day.","https://iiif.library.vanderbilt.edu/iiif/2/gallery%2F1999%2F1999.172dd.tif/0,0,2962,3784/800,/0/default.jpg",http://b57e392a-67fc-4b93-a365-55eb542b1abd,http://12379f2d-22b8-4bc0-8d9c-c53caaf76d7e

"The caption notes an exchange between a father and son. The son says, ""Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça, papa?""  which translates to ""What is that, dad?""

"In this lithograph, Honoreé Daumier offers a stark contrast to the horrors of war depicted in his other lithographs from Album du Siège. Here, the scene is one of apparent celebration, with fireworks exploding in the sky over a darkened Paris.

"However, the dialogue between the father and son reveals that these are not fireworks at all, but bombs falling on the city. The title's reference to a fireworks display on August 15th adds a layer of irony to the scene, highlighting the absurdity of celebrating while under siege.

Daumier's use of humor and irony in this lithograph offers a poignant critique of the disconnect between the ruling class and the suffering of ordinary people during wartime.,"https://iiif.library.vanderbilt.edu/iiif/2/gallery%2F1999%2F1999.172dd.tif/0,0,2962,3784/800,/0/default.jpg",http://b57e392a-67fc-4b93-a365-55eb542b1abd,http://12379f2d-22b8-4bc0-8d9c-c53caaf76d7e

"The lithograph depicts a portly, well-fed official with a smug expression on his face, surrounded by crates of food and drink. The official's dismissive statement highlights the callousness and lack of empathy shown by those in positions of privilege and power, especially during times of war. Daumier's use of caricature and satire in this lithograph is particularly effective, as he highlights the absurdity of the official's attitude and draws attention to the suffering and starvation of the less fortunate while Paris was under siege.","https://iiif.library.vanderbilt.edu/iiif/2/gallery%2F1999%2F1999.172b.tif/273,928,1932,1948/800,/0/default.jpg",http://08e1c257-8de5-4e34-a905-64bd4508025f,http://12379f2d-22b8-4bc0-8d9c-c53caaf76d7e
"Honoré Daumier's criticism of the Franco-Prussian War is evident throughout his Album du Siège lithographs. His works offer a scathing indictment of the conflict, and the suffering it inflicted upon ordinary people. Daumier's lithographs often focus on the impact of the war on civilians, particularly the hunger and deprivation caused by the siege of Paris. He also targets the corrupt and ineffectual government officials who were responsible for the war and its disastrous consequences. Daumier's work serves as a powerful critique of war as a destructive and futile enterprise, and a reminder of the human cost of political conflicts. His sharp social commentary and biting satire offer a powerful voice for those who suffered during this dark period in French history.","https://iiif.library.vanderbilt.edu/iiif/2/gallery%2F1999%2F1999.172b.tif/16,39,2558,3327/800,/0/default.jpg",http://08e1c257-8de5-4e34-a905-64bd4508025f,http://12379f2d-22b8-4bc0-8d9c-c53caaf76d7e
