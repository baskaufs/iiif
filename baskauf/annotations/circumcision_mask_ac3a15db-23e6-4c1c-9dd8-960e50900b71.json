The incorporation of wood and covered copper is an important symbol of wealth and a method of intimidating enemies\u2014to protect this small enclave against invasions by outside kingdoms.\nThe masks also act as guardians for the children and are believed to have spirits dwelling within them, while being used to initiate boys into the society of warriors and are earned through performing specific deeds, playing a vital role in the Sala Mpasu\u2019s warrior society, a powerful association through which men increased their authority by securing the right to wear particular masks.  Earning the right to wear a mask alsso involved performing large payments of livestock, drink, and other material goods. Once a man \u2018owned\u2019 the mask, other \u2018owners\u2019 taught this new member particular esoteric knowledge associated with it.\n"
