Daumier printed this lithograph in his Album du Si\u00e8ge, which depicts scenes of everyday life amidst the chaos of the Franco-Prussian war, the siege of Paris, and political satire aimed at the government and its leaders. France declared war on Prussia in July 1870, but was quickly defeated due to Prussia's superior military and tactics. The war had a devastating impact on French civilians, particularly those living in Paris, which was besieged for several months. Parisians' lives altered dramatically during the four month siege. During 23 nights of bombardement in January 1871, some 12,000 shells fell on Paris neighborhoods, killing about 400 people. "
