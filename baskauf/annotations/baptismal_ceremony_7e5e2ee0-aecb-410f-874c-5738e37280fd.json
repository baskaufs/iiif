Aspertini was a member of the Bolognese School of painting during the Italian High Renaissance. It depicts the baptism of St. Augustine by St. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, in 387 CE. This is a pivotal point in Catholic history, as St. Augustine proved to be a key figure who made major contributions to the Church through his writings. Similarly, St. Ambrose was also a major Catholic figure. This painting therefore illustrates a momentous time when one great man baptized what would soon become another great man."

He grew up outside of the Church, even living in sin by fathering a child out of wedlock or by endulging in very hedonistic persuits. During this time, he was improving his education in rhetoric, gaining a solid foundation for his later scholarly works. However, after having a great relgious awakening through reading the works of St. Paul, he converted to Christianity, While he appears to be in his adolescence or young adulthood here, historically he would have been about 31 at the time of his baptism. St. Augustine would go on to be considered one of the Great Church Fathers, for his many writings about Christianity such as Confessions and The City of God. He used his rhetoric education to preach, thus spreading Christianity and expanding the scholarly and intellectual nature of the religion."

He also carries a crozier staff which mimics a pastoral staff, a common Catholic staff design which references the allusion of Christ as the Good Shepherd. The white clothing worn by Ambrose may be a nod to the baptism of St. Augustine occurring during Easter\n\nSt. Ambrose is also considered a Great Church Father, also mainly for his writings. He was a large influcence on St. Augustine, both before and after the latter converted to Christianity. Some of his influence is accounted by Augustine in his Confessions. Ambrose was a fierce propoent of Catholicism both in speeches and in his writings, which led to his importance in the Church. "

The story goes that Augustine came upon a child who was trying to fit the ocean into a small hole in the sand. Upon Augustine's statement that fitting the vast ocean into the small hole, the child compares that to attempting to understand the Holy Trinity. The lesson here being that there are some mysteries and concepts that cannot be learned etiher all at once or at all.\n\nJesus, like Augustine and Ambrose, is wearing white. This is likely to symbolize the innocence and purity of the Christ child, similar to baptism. Jesus is usually depicted with a gold nimbus, or halo. This is omitted here, but there is a slight pattern to Ambrose's robes behind the child which mimic the shape of a nimbus."
