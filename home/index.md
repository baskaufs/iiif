# The project

Displaying rich information about artwork images using the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)

# Description

The [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io/) (IIIF) is a cutting-edge technology that provides a mechanism for displaying visual works using a web viewer allowing users to page through and zoom in on related artwork images. In this project, fellows will select a set of American artwork images from the [Fine Arts Gallery](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/gallery/) image collection, carry out research on the works, and create a IIIF manifest to display the works in a meaningful way. In the process, they will learn more about the IIIF technology as well as having in-depth experience with part of the Gallery collection. The results will be incorporated into the Gallery’s website redesign, allowing fellows’ research to be shared with a broad audience.
